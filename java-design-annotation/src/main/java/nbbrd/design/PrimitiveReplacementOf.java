/**
 * Specifies that a class is a primitive-friendly drop-in replacement of a
 * generic class.<p>Generics in Java don't handle primivites. You can't write
 * <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code>. Instead you have to write
 * <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>.<br>This leads to autoboxing (int &lt;-&gt;
 * Integer) and therefore some overhead. To avoid this problem, we use some
 * specialize classes.
