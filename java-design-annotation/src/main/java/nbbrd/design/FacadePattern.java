/**
 * Facade is a software design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a
 * larger body of code, such as a class library. A facade can:
 * <ul>
 * <li>make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the
 * facade has convenient methods for common tasks;
 * <li>make the library more readable, for the same reason;
 * <li>reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library,
 * since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing
 * the system;
 * <li>wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API
 * (as per task needs).
 * </ul>
