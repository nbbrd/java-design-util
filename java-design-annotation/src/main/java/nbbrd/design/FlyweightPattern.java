/**
 * Flyweight is a software design pattern that minimizes memory use by sharing
 * as much data as possible with other similar objects; it is a way to use
 * objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an
 * unacceptable amount of memory. Often some parts of the object state can be
 * shared, and it is common practice to hold them in external data structures
 * and pass them to the flyweight objects temporarily when they are used.
